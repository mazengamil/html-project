Programmers are in high demand these days--their fluency in coding language is invaluable. Knowing various
 programming languages is a no-brainer for engineers, but a basic understanding of the languages can benefit anyone,
 even if you're not looking to become a master coder. Grasping some general understanding of coding can help you make
 the right hires for your business needs, communicate better with the engineers on your team, and prevent any awkward 
misunderstandings (Ruby isn't a gem, and Java isn't an excellent cup of coffee). Plus, with the high salaries earned 
for coding, you might want to consider it for a future career move! So what do you need to know?

Here are the 10 most popular programming languages:

1. Java
Java is top pick as one of the most popular programming languages, used for building server-side applications to video
 games and mobile apps. It's also the core foundation for developing Android apps, making it a favorite of many 
programmers. With its WORA mantra (write once, run anywhere), it's designed to be portable and run happily across 
multiple software platforms. I first got started with Java server programming back in 1999--it was so exciting,
 I actually wrote a few books about it. Java is everybody's pal!

2. Python
Python is a one-stop shop. There's a Python framework for pretty much anything, from web apps to data analysis.
 In fact, WordStream is written in Python! You're the best bud. Python is often heralded as the easiest programming
 language to learn, with its simple and straightforward syntax. Python has risen in popularity due to Google's investment 
in it over the past decade (in fact, one recent study has shown Python to be the most commonly taught programming language
 in U.S. schools). Other applications built with Python include Pinterest and Instagram.
3. C
If you saw C on a report card, you'd be pretty bummed. Maybe a bit confused, too (is it actually a B-?). However, C is not the bizarrely bad grade it seems to be. It's often the first programming language taught in college (well, it was for me 10 years ago). I thought it was a nice "in-between" language in that it was object oriented without having to be fanatical about it. It was also low level enough to be close to hardware, but no so low level that you had to do everything manually. Because there are so many C compilers, you can write stuff in C and have it run pretty much anywhere.

4. Ruby
Ruby (also known as Ruby on Rails) is a major supplier of web apps. Ruby is popular due to its ease of learning 
(it's very straightforward) and power. Ruby knowledge is in high demand these days!

5. JavaScript
JavaScript (which, confusingly, is not at all related to Java) is another favorite programming language because 
it's so ubiquitous on the web--it's basically everywhere. JavaScript allows developers to add interactive elements 
to their website, and its presence is felt across the internet. At WordStream, we use a JavaScript library called
 JQuery to make our JavaScript work even easier.

6. C#
C# (pronounced C-sharp, not C-hashtag for you Twitter fans) is the language used in order to develop Microsoft apps.
 C# is syntactically nearly identical to Java. I've spent much time training with C#, but if you're good at Java,
 you'll likely have an easy time jumping onto C#. If you're looking to work on Microsoft apps, C# is the way to go. 
C# opens a lot of Windows (har-har).

7. PHP
PHP (which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, if you care to know) is often used in conjunction with dynamic data-heavy
 websites and app development. It provides a ton of power and is the beating heart of monster sites like WordPress and
 Facebook. What's really cool about PHP is that it's an open-source language, so there are tons of free pre-built modules
 that you can grab and modify to get your ideal results. PHP is also on the easy end of the learning spectrum, simply
 requiring you to embed the code within HTML. PHP is a must-learn language for aspiring web developers.

8. Objective-C
Objective-C is the programming language behind iOS apps. Apple's new language Swift is rising in the ranks, but
 Objective-C is still the recommended starting point for those looking to craft Apple apps for iPhones and iPads.
 Next stop--the iOS App Store!

9. SQL
SQL is a database query language (SQL stands for Structured Query Language) that's ideal when talking big data.
 SQL lets you siphon helpful data from massive databases. Nearly every app has a backend database, and SQL is the
 language that helps you interact with that sweet data. In terms of software development, SQL isn't ever used 
alone--rather, you invoke SQL from some other programming knowledge and you have yourself a nice package deal.

10. C 
C is the predecessor to more complex programming languages like Java and C#. C is best when you want to work
 small and when dealing with low-level applications. It's widely used for embedded systems like the firmware 
of your television or the operating system of an airplane, as well as computer operating systems like Windows. 
For me personally, C was more of an academic language. It was nice to learn how to write a kernel back in college,
 and you gain a more solid understanding of how newer languages work under the covers, but it's rare for most application
 developers to ever have to use this today.

There you have it--the king languages of coding. What's your programming language of choice and why? If you're a newbie 
looking to dive into coding, take a look at these nine spots on the web where you can learn to code (for free)! You'll
 be a code master in no time.
